The system should store the deck as a list of ints from 0-51
	-Page 256 in the book has a good write up on this
	-Int variable to keep track of how many cards have been dealt to call to ensure call to next card.
	-After a card is dealt change that card position to a 0, That way we can check when a card gets dealt
	--> if card == 0, then Card_Count +=1...

The system should deal two random cards from the deck to both the dealer and player

	-I think we should store each players cards in a 2D array

	-Int Dealt_Cards[][] = new int[2][8] Since the player cant go over 21 the most card they could be dealt is 8
	--> 2+2+2+2+3+3+3+3 = 20. So 2 players, upto 8 cards.

The user can view one of the cards the dealer was dealt
	-Simple, print just one card.

The user can view the two cards they were dealt
	-Print both

The user can HIT or STAND until they BUST or choose to STAND
	Hit: one additional card will be added, if not bust same questions are asked.
	Stand: You are pleased with your your cards total and no longer want to continue
	BUST: Score>21

The user receives another card if they choose to HIT
	-Add card to players
	-Increment deck position count variable
	-Add card to players total 

The system deals the dealer cards until they BUST, cards total 17+, or they beat the players hand

	-Basically if the dealer has a 10 and a 2 for 12 and they hit and get a 4. The dealer now has
	-->16 and HAS to hit again because its less than 17. If the dealer gets an Ace they will have
	-->17 and HAS to stop drawing and the dealers and players cards are compared.

The user can choose to play again or quit
